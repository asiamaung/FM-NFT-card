## Overview
Hello! This is my solution to the [NFT preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/nft-preview-card-component-SbdUL_w0U). This was a fun challenge for me to brush up on my frontend skills and get accustomed to Github with my morning coffee ☕️.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned + Continued development

Since I've been using platforms like WordPress and Webflow for work it's been awhile since I've built out a full project in pure HTML/CSS. This was a quick exercise to freshen up on frontend and practice version control workflow in Github. In the future I'll focus more on:
-  Trying out frameworks like Tailwind CSS
-  Learning React
